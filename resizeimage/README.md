# Image Manipulation by UJIKSTARK

## PIP you should install
1. Pillow

## How to use that ?
i make it with python3 so let's do it :) :
1. put your picture you wanna resize in image
2. open terminal and type `python3 ujik.py` and will appear `Image : ` fill this with your picture you put on image 
3. and will appear `width and height` type like 1080 for width and 720 for height and the quality you can type 1-100 but i suggest you to type 100 :)
4. give the new name of your picture . and it will make a new file directly
5. success! :)
